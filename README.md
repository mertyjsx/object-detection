# i-am-not-a-robot
We wanted to have another approach to this problem but with more fun involved. By using deep learning object detection, we have created a some sort of CAPTCHA system. It simply works as follows:
The application asks for a webcam access and asks the user to prove they are not a robot by asking them to make a few generally known hand gestures in front of the camera. If the user is able to recreate hand gestures shown on the test, they can enter the site. Since this system is only targeted for people with normal hands only, we are still thinking of another ways to suit this system also for the disabled people but this might not happen as we are still in search of other ideas.
